## [1.1.0] - 2023-07-21

### Added

- Process requirement R1500 for consideration of clock misalignment ([#154](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/154)).
- Use cases _Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service_ and _Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service and clock drift is unacceptable_ ([#155](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/155)). 
- MDIB Efficiency clause ([#50](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/50)).
- Requirement explicitly forbidding manual TS service configuration ([#30](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/30))
- Added safety, security and effectiveness requirements to use case _Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service_ ([#31](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/31)).
- Added safety, security and effectiveness requirements for use case _Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service and clock drift is unacceptable_ ([#31](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/31)).
- Labeling requirement to use case _Device is connected to the MD LAN network with a Time Source service_ to specify NTP configuration ([#151](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/151)). 
- Added two requirements: One for the accompanying documentation to make sure that participants synchronize with the same time-server and one that explicitly forbids executing system functions without a TS service, when a device is connected to the network. ([#202](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/202))


### Changed

- Use case _Device is connected to the MD LAN network and a user wants to change the device's time_ to account for the fact, that configuring the TS service manually is always forbidden, not just when TS service is operational ([#30](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/30)).
- Changed use case _Devices are operational in the MD LAN network but cannot access the TS Service and clock drift is unacceptable_ so that the decision to continue/discontinue the execution of a System Function while the clocks become less accurate lies with the consumer ([#31](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/31)). 
- Open/Closed Issues sections have been revised. Sections are now generated automatically from Github issues ([#20](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/20)).
- Created a common section for the ACM and DEC gateways such that requirement numbers are not duplicated anymore ([#53](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/53)).  
- Rephrase R1542 to make sure, that system functions not being available don't lead to unnecessary alarms ([#180] (https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/180)). 
- Moved requirements R1542 & R1543 to the SDPi-P SES / Effectiveness section from Github issues ([#182](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/182)).

### Removed

- Normalized "profile" to "Profile" where appropriate ([#189](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/189))).
- Normalized "section" to "Section" when it was referring to a specific clause within the document ([#189](https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/189)).

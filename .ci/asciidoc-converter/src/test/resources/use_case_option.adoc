=== Use Case Feature 1: Synchronized time across devices (STAD)

==== Narrative
Nurse Jean attaches a ventilator to the medical device network in the ICU.  It automatically obtains the correct time.

==== Benefits
Automatically acquiring the time saves the user from spending time entering the time into the device.  It also guarantees that the correct time will be entered.
It is also important for all devices to have a consistent time since the data being exported to consuming devices and systems will use the time stamps from the device to mark the time that the clinical data was acquired.  Since this is part of the clinical record, accuracy is very important.

==== Technical Pre-Conditions

[role=use-case-background]
====
*Given* All devices communicate using a common acronym_md_lan protocol

*And* A Time Source (TS) Service is on the acronym_md_lan network
====

==== Scenarios

[role=use-case-scenario,sdpi_scenario="Device is connected to the MD LAN network with a Time Source service"]
===== Scenario: STAD 1.1 --- Device is connected to the MD LAN network with a Time Source service

[role=use-case-steps]
====
*Given* Device has detected at least one TS Service

*When* The TS Service is operational

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the TS Service
====

[role=use-case-scenario,sdpi_scenario="User wants to change the time of a device connected to the MD LAN network"]
===== Scenario: STAD 1.2 --- Device is connected to the MD LAN network and a user wants to change the deviceâ€™s time

[role=use-case-steps]
====
*Given* Device is operational in MD LAN network

*When* The user attempts to change the time on the device manually

*Then* The device will disable the ability to change its time manually

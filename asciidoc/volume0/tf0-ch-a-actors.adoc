[cols="1,2"]

|Existing Actor Name |Definition

|[[actor_alert_consumer,Alert Consumer]] Alert Consumer
| The Alert Consumer (ACON) receives the alert from the Alert Reporter (AR) and uses the alert information strictly as a consumer of the alert being raised.  There is no implementation requirement for how the ACON ultimately uses the alert information.

|[[actor_alert_manager,Alert Manager]] Alert Manager
| The Alert Manager (AM) receives the alerts from the Alert Reporter (AR), potentially analyzes the alert, and dispatches the alert to the Alert Communicator (AC), and optionally, provides the alert to the Alert Archiver (AA) or Alert Consumer (ACON) upon subscription.

|[[actor_alert_reporter,Alert Reporter]] Alert Reporter
| This actor originates the alert (an alarm, either physiological or technical, or an advisory).

|[[actor_device_observation_consumer,Device Observation Consumer]] Device Observation Consumer
| The actor responsible for receiving PCD data from the Device Observation Reporter, the Device Observation Filter, or both.

|[[actor_device_observation_reporter,Device Observation Reporter]] Device Observation Reporter
| The Device Observation Reporter (DOR) receives data from PCDs, including those based on proprietary formats, and maps the received data to transactions providing consistent syntax and semantics.


| Time Client

| Establishes time synchronization with one or more Time Servers using the NTP protocol and either the NTP or SNTP algorithms.  Maintains the local computer system clock synchronization with UTC based on synchronization with the Time Servers.

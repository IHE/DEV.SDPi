| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*: The General Introduction Appendix D Glossary in this initial version of the supplement includes all terms and acronyms that are utilized throughout the other volumes.  Subsequent versions of the supplement may re-locate items to other tables and sections within the technical framework.  To help differentiate between various classes or categories of terms, a *_new "Type" column_* has been added.  This could enable future dynamic resorting of the table by those users who are interested in, for example, only organizational definitions.  Finally, a *_References column_* has been added to pull this information out of the Definition column.

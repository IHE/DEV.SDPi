=== SDPi "Topic of Interest" Issue Management

All SDPi supplement issues are tracked in the https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/issues[IHE Github sdpi-fhir repository Issues section]. Filter the issues on "SDPi Topic of Interest" to see a full list.  +

For more detailed information on how the Gemini SES+MDI program manages issues from identification to resolution to incorporation into this supplement, see the wiki article https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/wiki/Program-Coordination-Co-Working-Spaces#overview-from-discussion-to-planning-to-development[_Overview: From Discussion to Planning to Development_] and the confluence article https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=82912211#TopicsofInterest-TopicResolutionWorkflow[_Topics of Interest -- Topic Resolution Workflow_].

=== Open Issues and Questions

* *Issue:* https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=86970701[*SystemContext Profiling & Use*]
** How should SDPi profile(s) use the SDC SystemContext (Location, Patient, Ensemble, Workflow) capabilities?  Including device pairing / coupling.  Which SystemContext component?  Is this an option on the SDPi-P profile?  Other profiles?  IEEE 11073-1070x PKP requirements?

* *Issue:* *_MDIB Version Update Guidelines_*
** SDC provides "version" indicators to enable CONSUMER systems to determine what has changed.  However, this can result in considerable "chatter" on the network if not properly managed.  What guidelines and requirements should be specified in SDPi-P?  Also how managed with waveforms vs. parameters.

* *Issue:* *_Profiling BICEPS Services in SDPi-P_*
** SDC/BICEPS provides a general service model that supports many implementation approaches.  How should the services be utilized in SDPi-Plug-n-trust 1.0?

* *Issue:* https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91994093[*_Security Certificate Provisioning_*]
** ISO/IEEE 11073-20702 MDPWS defines how WS-Security w/ X.509 certificates and Extended Key Use (EKU) provisions should be adapted for SDC; however, SDPi profiles will not only add specificity, but also address operationalization challenges including security certificate provisioning.  What should be added to the SDPi supplement to support this operationalization?  What should be added to the Gemini SDPi+FHIR program, including tooling and testing, to support SDPi security?

* *Issue:* *_BICEPS Extension Model Use in SDPi?_*
** SDC provides for extensions, especially in BICEPS.  How should these be included and utilized in SDPi?  A key issue to avoid is the infamous HL7 V2 "Z" segment, which was over used and negatively impacted interoperability.

* *Issue:* https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Topic%3A+Discovery+Proxy+Actors[*_Discovery Proxy Actors_*]
** Note: _This issue is targeted for v1.1 but may have some element in v1.0_
** ISO/IEEE 11073 SDC provides for both implicit and explicit discovery; however, for some implementations this may result in unwanted message traffic across the network; the use of a "discovery proxy" has been proposed and could be added as an optional SDPi actor.

* *Issue: _SDPi-xC with Mixed Device Safety Classes_*
** https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/issues/61[Github Issue #61 _Topic: SDPi-xC with Mixed Device Safety Classes_]
** FOR SDPi 1.0 -- Basic text was added to the SES template sections to indicate the nature of the issue, but not to indicate its resolution or even if WILL be explicitly resolved (incl. if the safety classification aspect of <<acronym_biceps>> will be maintained).  See <<vol3_clause_biceps_ses_content_requirements_considerations>> Reviewers Note box that presents the issue in SDPi 1.0 and beyond.

* *Issue: _Handling missed discovery messages_*
** https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/issues/96[Github Issue #96 _Append TOI: Handling missed discovery messages_]

** Changes were made in line with https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Topic%3A+Handling+missed+discovery+messages[TOI Page: Handling missed discovery messages]; Requirements were introduced on the use of Hello message recurrence and size, SOAP-over-UDP, and Probe message recurrence. This was implemented in Vol 2, Annex A, Sections <<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_23_recurring_hello>>,<<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_23_hello_message_size>>, and <<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_24_recurring_probe>>.

* *Issue: _SDPi-P Compression Option_*
** https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/issues/97[Github Issue #97 _Append TOI: Compression Option_] +

** Changes were made in line with https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Topic%3A+SDPi-P+Compression+Option[TOI Page: SDPi-P Compression Option]; In a nutshell, two requirements on gzip compression were introduced. This was implemented in Vol 2, Annex A, Section <<vol2_appendix_a_mdpws_messages>>.

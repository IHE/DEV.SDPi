a| *SDPi 1.1 Supplement -- _Trial Implementation Version_ -- Note*:

This release of the SDPi 1.1 Trial Implementation supplement establishes a quarterly update cadence, enabling prototyping and testing of device-to-device plug-and-trust interoperability.
It is recognized, though, that this is an *incremental* 1.1 release and in that sense is understandably incomplete with work continuing for 1.2 and subsequent versions.
These known limitations include:


. The content is scoped per the *_SDPi 1.1 version capabilities specification_* (see https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/wiki/SDPi-Editorial-Planning-and-Versions#sdpi-version-11-detail---[wiki article "SDPi Version 1.1 (Detail)"]), though future capabilities may be included in a Version Note
. This supplement includes (4) SDPi profiles, though the typical IHE supplement is organized for a single profile; as a result, some adjustments have been made, especially in the supplement overview section where there is a general SDPi overview and then basic overviews for each of the profiles; challenging areas include profile "options" where there are FOUR sections vs. one; it is a work in progress and feedback is appreciated, especially to enhance clarity
. *Open / Closed Issues tables* -- for SDPi 1.1 the approach for the open / closed issues section has been integrated with the Github Issues that are related to this release; it is expected that this automation will continue to evolve in subsequent releases;
. *Requirements boxes* (e.g., "R1234") have been added especially in TF-2, with some also part of TF-1 and TF-3; this is an initial approach that *_will be significantly expanded in future versions of the supplement_*; an initial approach is provided in <<vol1_clause_sdpi_requirements_modeling_integration>>, with discussion related to how it will be expanded in future versions of the supplement;
. *_<<term_safe_effective_secure>> Sections_* (see <<vol1_clause_appendix_a_ses_considerations_section_template>>) are included in the specification; however, their use and content will be significantly extended in SDPi 1.x and subsequent versions;
. This supplement is currently rendered as a *"long form"* document -- one single HTML file; however, in subsequent versions the intent is to consider a multi-page / file HTML rendering + addition of a tabbed menu for navigating the sections of the supplement;
. *"SDPi 1.1 Supplement Note"* boxes are provided throughout the document to help guide reviewers and implementers.

[#supplement_clause_sdpi_supplement_overview]
== SDPi Supplement Overview

[#supplement_clause_sdpi_supplement_organization]
=== SDPi Supplement Organization

This IHE Devices Technical Framework supplement introduces a new _family of interoperability profiles_, Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi), that comprise (4) separate profiles:

* SDPi-Plug-and-trust (*SDPi-P*) Profile
* SDPi-Reporting (*SDPi-R*) Profile
* SDPi-Alerting (*SDPi-A*) Profile
* SDPi-external Control (*SDPi-xC*) Profile

To that end, the supplement includes updates to all (3) IHE DEV TF volumes, including:

*TF-1  Profiles*

* General overview of the SDPi architectural approach & integrated set of profiles
* Profile specific sections
* Related appendices, for example the integration of this family of SDPi profiles with other sources of requirements - use cases or reference standards

*TF-2  Transactions*

* Extensive new set of transactions based on ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) medical device interoperability standards.
* Related appendices, for example the specialized use of web services messaging for device communication and gateways to other protocols or profiles

*TF-3  Content Modules*

* New content covering the application of ISO/IEEE 11073 SDC semantic standards to device content modules, with a primary focus on specifications related to the ISO/IEEE 11073-10207 BICEPS standard.

[#supplement_clause_joint_ihe_hl7_gemini_ses_mdi_project_development]
=== Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini SES+MDI Project Development
This supplement is the result of a joint https://confluence.hl7.org/x/Xzf9Aw[IHE-HL7 Gemini Device Interoperability program] which began early 2020.
Extensive notes and discussion materials are provided on the project's HL7 Confluence site, including a https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=113674346#LibrarywithEVERYTHINGyoueverwantedtoknow...-GeneralUpdate&BriefingPresentations[Library with extensive presentations and other materials].
This Library also includes *_briefings (slides and recordings) to provide background for those reviewing the specification_*.

The joint IHE-HL7 devices team leveraged tools from both organizations, as well as participated jointly throughout the project's multi-year efforts.

The methods currently employed are provided in the wiki article:  https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/wiki/Program-Coordination-Co-Working-Spaces#program-coordination--co-working-spaces[Program Coordination & Co-Working Spaces].

[#supplement_clause_supplement_support_for_ri_mc_rr_using_asciidoc]
=== Supplement Support for RI+MC+RR using AsciiDoc
In addition to the supplement's technical specification content, a development approach has been advanced that represents added value to adopters and implementers over the traditional document oriented approach.
These are referred to as:

[none]
. *_Requirements Interoperability + Model Centric + Regulatory Ready_*

Or *RI+MC+RR* for short.

These three objectives may be summarized as follows:

[none]
* *Requirements Interoperability (RI)*
[none]
** Ability to integrate & automate requirements and capabilities from component specifications & standards to enable traceability & coverage at <<term_conformity_assessment>> (<<acronym_ca>>) of the component product interface
* *Model Centric (MC)*
[none]
** Transition from a document-centric to a _computable model-based "single source of truth"_ specification from which the Technical Framework becomes a view of the model
* *Regulatory Ready (RR)*
[none]
** Enable CA test reports that are genuinely _"regulatory submission ready"_ (e.g., inclusion in a U.S. FDA 510(k) submission package)

The SDPi 1.1 version of the supplement has *_begun to take small steps_* toward support of these objectives, especially Requirements Interoperability, as well as the use of AsciiDoc metadata to annotate the document sources for post-processing.
Clearly, moving toward <<term_model_centric>> specifications and full integration of <<term_model_based_systems_engineering>> (<<acronym_mbse>>) will take considerable effort and time; however, this supplement represents a humble start in that direction.
Subsequent supplement versions will build upon these objectives and support a new level of rigor for connectathon and product conformity assessment testing and ultimately test reports that directly impact the challenges around medical product regulatory submissions.

Additional discussion is provided in <<vol1_appendix_a_requirements_management_for_p_n_t_interperability>>, and on the https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=82906664#ConformityAssessment&Tooling-RI+MC+RRforMedTechSpecificationsInitiative[Gemini project's confluence pages].

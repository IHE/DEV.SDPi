a| *SDPi 1.0 Supplement -- _Public Comment Review Version_ -- Note*:

This release of the SDPi 1.0 supplement is intended for *IHE Public Comment review*, with a focus on both technical content as well editorial maturity (e.g., clarity, grammar, formatting, etc.).
It is recognized that there are both technical and editorial issues that need to be resolved before the Trial Implementation version is released.  Known issues with this Public Comment version include:

. The content is scoped per the *_SDPi 1.0 version capabilities specification_* (see https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/wiki/SDPi-Editorial-Planning-and-Versions#sdpi-version-10-detail-[wiki article "SDPi Version 1.0 (Detail)"]), though future capabilities may be included in a Reviewer Note; *_continued development of SDPi 1.x and beyond will begin early in 2023 DURING the 1.0 review periods_*;
. Supplement organization is *_based on the IHE Supplement Template from 2020 and 2022 (v10.6)_*; as a supplement to the IHE Devices technical framework, the section allocation and organization anticipates the IHE PCD 2019 (see <<vol1_appendix_b_references>>) being updated into an IHE DEV 2022 version that also conforms to the updated IHE Techncial Feramework template(s);
. This supplement includes (4) SDPi profiles; however, the general IHE Supplement Template is organized for a single profile; as a result, some adjustments have been made, especially in the supplement overview section where there is a general SDPi overview and then basic overviews for each of the profiles; challenging areas include profile "options" where there are FOUR sections vs. one; it is a work in progress and feedback is appreciated, especially for clarity;
. *Open / Closed Issues tables* -- for SDPi 1.0 there is an initial approach that integrates with the Gemini SES+MDI program work flow (from Confluence issues to Github Issues to specification content); however, there is discussion around how to better improve this in future
. *Requirements boxes* (e.g., "R1234") have been added especially in TF-2 and some in TF-3; this is an initial approach that *_will be significantly expanded in future versions of the supplement_*; an initial approach is provided in <<vol1_clause_sdpi_requirements_modeling_integration>>, with discussion related to how it will be expanded in future versions of the supplement;
. *_<<term_safe_effective_secure>> Sections_* (see <<vol1_clause_appendix_a_ses_considerations_section_template>>) are included in the specification; however, their use and content will be significantly extended in SDPi 1.x and subsequent versions;
. This supplement is currently rendered as a *"long form"* document -- one single HTML file; however, in subsequent versions the intent is to consider a multi-page / file HTML rendering + addition of a tabbed menu for navigating the sections of the supplement;
. *FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT* version of the supplement, the document source was migrated from the IHE sdpi-fhir Github to a new IHE DEV.SDPi profile-specific Github repository; links to the old repository may remain or may be updated to the new depending on the material being referenced (e.g., in open / closed issues).

*"SDPi 1.0 Supplement Note"* boxes are provided throughout the document to help guide reviewers and to ask specific questions for feedback requested by the supplement editors.

*REVIEWER FOCUS*:  Please review the document especially with a technical and general organizational focus.
Does the information flow logically and sufficiently for adopters and implementers?
Is the text clear and sufficient or do specific subject areas need to be expanded or reworked.
Do the links work and lead to the right "best" destinations?

[#supplement_clause_sdpi_supplement_overview]
== SDPi Supplement Overview

[#supplement_clause_sdpi_supplement_organization]
=== SDPi Supplement Organization

This IHE Devices Technical Framework supplement introduces a new _family of interoperability profiles_, Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi), that comprise (4) separate profiles:

* SDPi-Plug-and-trust (*SDPi-P*) Profile
* SDPi-Reporting (*SDPi-R*) Profile
* SDPi-Alerting (*SDPi-A*) Profile
* SDPi-external Control (*SDPi-xC*) Profile

To that end, the supplement includes updates to all (3) IHE DEV TF volumes, including:

*TF-1  Profiles*

* General overview of the SDPi architectural approach & integrated set of profiles
* Profile specific sections
* Related appendices, for example the integration of this family of SDPi profiles with other sources of requirements - use cases or reference standards

*TF-2  Transactions*

* Extensive new set of transactions based on ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) medical device interoperability standards.
* Related appendices, for example the specialized use of web services messaging for device communication and gateways to other protocols or profiles

*TF-3  Content Modules*

* New content covering the application of ISO/IEEE 11073 SDC semantic standards to device content modules, with a primary focus on specifications related to the ISO/IEEE 11073-10207 BICEPS standard.

[#supplement_clause_joint_ihe_hl7_gemini_ses_mdi_project_development]
=== Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini SES+MDI Project Development
This supplement is the result of a joint https://confluence.hl7.org/x/Xzf9Aw[IHE-HL7 Gemini Device Interoperability program] which began early 2020.
Extensive notes and discussion materials are provided on the project's HL7 Confluence site, including a https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=113674346#LibrarywithEVERYTHINGyoueverwantedtoknow...-GeneralUpdate&BriefingPresentations[Library with extensive presentations and other materials].
This Library also includes *_briefings (slides and recordings) to provide background for those reviewing the specification_*.

The joint IHE-HL7 devices team leveraged tools from both organizations, as well as participated jointly throughout the project's multi-year efforts.

The methods currently employed are provided in the wiki article:  https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/wiki/Program-Coordination-Co-Working-Spaces#program-coordination--co-working-spaces[Program Coordination & Co-Working Spaces].

[#supplement_clause_supplement_support_for_ri_mc_rr_using_asciidoc]
=== Supplement Support for RI+MC+RR using AsciiDoc
In addition to the supplement's technical specification content, a development approach has been advanced that represents added value to adopters and implementers over the traditional document oriented approach.
These are referred to as:

[none]
. *_Requirements Interoperability + Model Centric + Regulatory Ready_*

Or *RI+MC+RR* for short.

These three objectives may be summarized as follows:

[none]
* *Requirements Interoperability (RI)*
[none]
** Ability to integrate & automate requirements and capabilities from component specifications & standards to enable traceability & coverage at <<term_conformity_assessment>> (<<acronym_ca>>) of the component product interface
* *Model Centric (MC)*
[none]
** Transition from a document-centric to a _computable model-based "single source of truth"_ specification from which the Technical Framework becomes a view of the model
* *Regulatory Ready (RR)*
[none]
** Enable CA test reports that are genuinely _"regulatory submission ready"_ (e.g., inclusion in a U.S. FDA 510(k) submission package)

The initial SDPi 1.0 version of the supplement has *_begun to take small steps_* toward support of these objectives, especially Requirements Interoperability, as well as the use of AsciiDoc metadata to annotate the document sources for post-processing.
Clearly, moving toward <<term_model_centric>> specifications and full integration of <<term_model_based_systems_engineering>> (<<acronym_mbse>>) will take considerable effort and time; however, this supplement represents a humble start in that direction.
Subsequent supplement versions will build upon these objectives and support a new level of rigor for connectathon and product conformity assessment testing and ultimately test reports that directly impact the challenges around medical product regulatory submissions.

Additional discussion is provided in <<vol1_appendix_a_requirements_management_for_p_n_t_interperability>>, and on the https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=82906664#ConformityAssessment&Tooling-RI+MC+RRforMedTechSpecificationsInitiative[Gemini project's confluence pages].

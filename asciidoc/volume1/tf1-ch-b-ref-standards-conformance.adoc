| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*: The inclusion of a References appendix is unique for IHE Technical Framework specifications.
Typically, referenced standards sections are distributed throughout the specifications where appropriate; however, standards from other organizations (e.g., IEEE, ISO, IEC) typically have a "Normative References" clause and when desired a "Bibliography" clause.
Also, integration of explicit standards' <<term_implementation_conformance_statement>> specifications (e.g., <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> <<acronym_ics>> tables) is unique, but needed to support requirements interoperability.

Ultimately, the content of this appendix may be rearranged and even relocated; however, for early versions of the SDPi supplement, it has proven helpful, and even of critical importance and value.

=== Bibliography

In addition to Referenced Standards, which include normative requirements and capabilities that this technical framework utilizes, there are other standards, specifications, publications, presentations, materials, etc. that have proven valuable in both developing and understanding the framework's content.  This list identifies those items, including many of which are referenced throughout the specifications.

==== Narrative
Nurse Jean attaches a ventilator to the medical device network in the ICU.  It automatically obtains the correct time.

==== Benefits
Automatically acquiring the time saves the user from spending time entering the time into the device.  It also guarantees that the correct time will be entered.
It is also important for all devices to have a consistent time since the data being exported to consuming devices and systems will use the time stamps from the device to mark the time that the clinical data was acquired.  Since this is part of the clinical record, accuracy is very important.

===== Scenario: <<acronym_stad>> {var_use_case_id}.6 - A device, operational in the MD LAN network, determines a non-slewing time adjustment is required

[role=use-case-steps]
====
*Given* The device is operational on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network,

*When* The device's <<term_clock_discipline_algorithm>> determines an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> is required,

*Then* The device will create a log entry that includes at least a <<term_timestamp>> for the adjustment in both the <<term_time_reference_frame>> before and after the <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> was made,

*And* The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> will notify <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>s, using its system function contributions (<<acronym_sfc>>), of the change to the provider's <<term_time_reference_frame>>,  

*Or* The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> will initiate a new MDIB sequence.
====

NOTE: a device's <<term_time_reference_frame>> may jump forward or backward in time in a single large (e.g., more than 5 minutes), step (from the perspective of an external observer) following an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>. 

NOTE: two distinct <<term_epoch>>s are created by an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>: one prior to the abrupt adjustment and one after. Each epoch has a distinct <<term_time_reference_frame>>. Both the rate which time passes and the determination time assigned to a single event may differ significantly between epochs (from the perspective of an external observer). 

NOTE: <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>s may occur, for example, when a device is used in an emergency or wireless situation and collects data before joining a network and updating its clock, an absent <<acronym_ts_service>> returns to operation, following hardware failure or operator error (e.g., making <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>s to the <<acronym_ts_service>> <<term_time_reference_frame>> while it is being used by one or more <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>s). 

NOTE: although an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> starts with a constant offset between two <<term_epoch>>s at a single point in time, it may introduce constant or variable (linear and/or non-linear) offsets between timestamps obtained within the <<term_epoch>>s. That is, the difference (to an unbiased observer) between any two timestamps from different epochs may depend (linearly or non-linearly) on when, within each epoch, the timestamp was obtained. It is typically not possible to establish a common <<term_time_reference_frame>> following an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> without additional information not available to the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>.

* initiate a new MDIB sequence by assigning a new <<acronym_mdib>> sequence identifier, or
* set `pm:ClockState/@ActivationState` to `StndBy` when any timestamp in a <<acronym_mdib>> version was not obtained from the time-reference frame of the active clock in the same version, or 
* set `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` to the earliest time that is unambiguously in the current <<term_epoch>> and increment `sdpi:Epochs/@Version` and set `pm:ClockState/@ActivationState` to `StndBy` while any timestamp in a <<acronym_mdib>> version is less than `pm:ClockState/@LastSet`.
====

[NOTE]
====
* The <<term_manufacturer>> of the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> considers the risks arising from <<term_timestamp>>s spanning <<term_time_reference_frame>>s from an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> having occurred at the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> when the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> receives a changed value in the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>'s MDIB sequence identifier or when the `pm:ClockState/@ActivationState` is `StndBy`.

* This clarifies the ambiguity in <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>, section B.182 and <<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>>, R0014 when a participant uses slewing to make <<term_smooth_time_adjustments>> (using, for example, the <<ref_rfc_5905, NTPv4>> <<term_clock_discipline_algorithm>>) where information from one or more <<acronym_ts_service>>s is used to maintain clock-discipline and does not (generally) "set" the clock.

* Any <<term_timestamp>> strictly-less than `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` in the MDIB when `pm:ClockState/@ActivationState` is set to `StndBy` may be untrustworthy. 
====
****

Timestamps obtained in an earlier <<term_epoch>> may be treated with greater suspicion than those obtained in the current epoch by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>. `pm:ClockState/@LastSet` provides the unambiguous beginning of the current epoch using a <<term_timestamp>> from the current epoch. For example (and illustrated below):

* when an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> moves the device's <<term_time_reference_frame>> forward, any <<term_timestamp>> in the MDIB greater than start of the new epoch are unambiguously in the new epoch. 
* when the device's <<term_time_reference_frame>> moves backward, only <<term_timestamp>>s greater than the latest timestamp obtained from the prior epoch are unambiguously in the current epoch. That is, timestamps obtained from the new <<term_time_reference_frame>> may overlap timestamps obtained from the prior <<term_time_reference_frame>>. 

There is no overlap in timestamps when an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> shifts the device clock forward in time. 

image::../images/vol1-diagram-use-case-stad-ns-forward.svg[align=center]

When an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> shifts the device's <<term_time_reference_frame>> back in time, only timestamps before the last timestamp recorded in the MDIB from epoch 0 belong unambiguously to the new <<term_time_reference_frame>>.

image::../images/vol1-diagram-use-case-stad-ns-back.svg[align=center]

When a device experiences several <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>s in a short period of time, the earliest timestamp unambiguously in the current <<term_time_reference_frame>> may be from an earlier <<term_epoch>>.

*Then* The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> will notify next users of data of suspicious timestamps.
====

NOTE: an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> is an extremely rare event on a properly functioning <<acronym_md_lan>> network, nonetheless participants should be prepared to continue <<term_system_function_contribution>> where possible.

Consider, for example, a medical device used for spot measurements, and
collects measurements in an area without network coverage before connecting to a <<acronym_md_lan>> network, synchronizing its clock and making collected data available. Such a device may have a precise, though inaccurate, clock before synchronizing with the organization reference clock creating an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>, as shown below. The clock might be inaccurate because the medical device was powered off for some time or it may have been used on a different <<acronym_md_lan>> network with a different reference clock. Measurements made before the <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> could be corrected by applying a suitable offset. These adjustments could be made, before making the data available to a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>, by the medical device itself, or later using offsets conveyed  using the <<vol3_clause_timestamp_versioning, timestamp versioning>> extension.

image::../images/vol1-diagram-use-case-stad-cns-linear.svg[align-center]

It may be difficult or impossible for a device to determine the correct timestamp for a historical measurement following an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>. Consider, for example, a device with a clock that is running slower than the Responsible Organization's reference clock as illustrated below (exaggerated for clarity). Synchronizing the clock at 14:00 (organization-time) corrects future timestamps but it is not possible to correctly adjust earlier timestamps from device reports which differ from organization time between -1:00 and +3:00, depending on when they were made. 

image::../images/vol1-diagram-use-case-stad-cns-non-linear.svg[align-center]

An <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> occurring at the Responsible Organization's reference clock (when compared to global time standards) may also be difficult reconcile with various devices updating their clock following different synchronization schedules, as illustrated below.

A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> should use the low-precision `Date` field included in HTTP response messages (<<ref_rfc_9110>>, §6.6.1) to determine if discrepancies between <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> clocks exceed requirements for its <<term_system_function_contribution>>. 
====

[NOTE]
====
* This requirement supports a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> considering the risk resulting from erroneous timestamps <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022>>, RR1162. 
* The maximum discrepancy between participant clocks may depend on the protocol being used to synchronize time (`pm:ClockState/pm:ActiveSyncProtocol`). The time reported by two devices employing <<ref_rfc_5905, NTPv4>>, for example, may differ by more than 8 1/2 minutes, in a worst case scenario, without triggering an <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>. 
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> could detect discrepancies exceeding a few seconds, which may affect its <<term_system_function_contribution>>, using timestamps in HTTP headers, for example. 
* By monitoring timestamp on message responses (such as subscription renew requests), a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> may be able to take an appropriate action, such as alerting the operator, before using data with suspicious timestamps.

A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> should use the "preferred format", defined in  <<ref_rfc_9110, RFC9110 §5.6.7>>, for the `Date` field included in all HTTP response messages. 
====

[NOTE]
====
The `Date` field in HTTP response messages, as the best available approximation of the date and time of message generation, is mandatory for an origin server with a clock (<<ref_rfc_9110>>, §6.6.1) though several formats are supported. This clarifies obsolete formats shouldn't be be used.

A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> shall notify next users of invalid and/or suspicious timestamps arising from <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> that affect its <<term_system_function_contribution>>. 
====

[NOTE]
====
* Operators and downstream systems (e.g., central record keeping systems) may be impacted beyond the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>'s immediate <<term_system_function_contribution>> by inconsistencies in temporal data. 
* Notifying next users could include writing an entry in a log accessible to next users. 
* Notifying next users could visual and/or audible indication to operators through colour, iconography or visual styling on timestamps affected by the <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>.

A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>, adjusting invalid and/or suspicious timestamps arising from <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>>, should continue to treat the adjusted timestamp as invalid and/or suspicious. 
====

[NOTE]
====
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> may use information provided, for example, by the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> using, for example, the <<vol3_clause_timestamp_versioning, timestamp versioning>> extension to improve the accuracy of a suspicious timestamp. However timestamps may remain less accurate than had the <<term_abrupt_time_adjustment>> not occurred and it may still be appropriate to notify next users of this.

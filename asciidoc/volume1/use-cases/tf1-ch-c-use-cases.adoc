| *{supplement_note}*: This initial section of Appendix C is informative and is still being detailed.  Completion is deferred to a later version of SDPi.
It provides general background detail around how general (non-technology specific) clinical use case specifications are being utilized in this supplement.

*REVIEWER QUESTION*:  Please review the intended topics and identify any additional content that should be considered.  Especially helpful would be references to related standards and materials that would inform the approach taken in this appendix.

==== Rich History of Medical Device Interoperability (MDI) Use Cases

The vision of plug-and-play medical device interoperability has been an active pursuit since the early 1980's, with the IEEE 1073 group's formation in those early years.  Over the 40+ years, many projects -- both industry and standards-based -- have contributed to an ever growing set of real-world use cases, and the ISO/IEEE 11073 SDC program is no different.

Looking to leverage this wealth of use cases in considering SDPi, a "compendium of medical device oriented use cases" was created to facilitate referencing and use.  The use cases detailed in this appendix build on those that are captured in this document:  <<ref_ihe_pcd_sdpi_use_cases_compendium_2019>>

Each Use Case (also called a Feature in Gherkin) is organized as follows:

* *Narrative* – a description of the desired functionality from the user perspective
* *Technical View* - graphic representation of typical business system actors utilized in this use case
* *Technical Pre-Conditions* – any assumptions or pre-conditions
* *Scenario(s)* – the scenarios explore both the Happy Path when everything goes according to plan and the Alternative Paths where things do not go according to plan.

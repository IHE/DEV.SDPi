=== Use Case Feature {var_use_case_id}: <<label_use_case_name_ddes>> (<<acronym_ddes>>)

// NOTE:  See use case labels in document-declarations.adoc

==== Narrative

Mercy Hospital is in the middle of a new <<acronym_ehr>> (Epic, Cerner, etc.) rollout.  Joe Furst is responsible for integrating data from their ICU devices (patient monitors, ventilators, infusion devices, etc.) with the new <<acronym_ehr>>.  Once they are done, the data from the devices will be reviewed/validated by the ICU clinicians and then automatically entered into the patient’s clinical record.

==== Benefits
Automatically feeding patient data from the medical devices to medical record applications reduces the documentation burden on the clinicians, improves the accuracy of the medical record and enables 'real-time' analysis of the data which can be used to generate (potentially AI based) smart alerts to the clinical staff.

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_ddes_technical_precondition]
==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using a common <<acronym_md_lan>> protocol

*And* There is at least one Data <<system_type_device_gateway>> (<<acronym_dgw>>) Service

*And* All devices report either a device label and/or location

*And* A <<acronym_dgw>> Service is associated with a specific set of device labels, and/or location(s) (i.e., devices in scope)

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_ddes_scenarios]
==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: <<acronym_ddes>> {var_use_case_id}.1 - New in scope device is connected to network with <<acronym_dgw>> service

*Given* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service has detected a new in scope device

*When* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service is operational

*Then* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service will connect to the device and export data to the EHR using the HL7 v2 based IHE DEV DOR actor of the DEV DEC Profile

////
#TODO:  REMOVE EXPLICIT PROFILE REFERENCES; let profiles link to gateway actors & profile roles#
////

===== Scenario: <<acronym_ddes>> {var_use_case_id}.2 - <<label_system_type_name_dgw>> Service is connected to the EHR

*Given* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service is exporting data to the EHR

*Then* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service will comply with all IHE DEV / PCD DEC Profile DOR actor functional and test requirements

===== Scenario: <<acronym_ddes>> {var_use_case_id}.3 - <<label_system_type_name_dgw>> Service has a failure

*Given* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service was connected to in scope devices and to an Enterprise system and fails

*Then* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service will backfill its data store and then backfill to the EHR when it recovers from its failure

===== Scenario: <<acronym_ddes>> {var_use_case_id}.4 - <<label_system_type_name_dgw>> Service connection to the Enterprise System fails

*Given* The Enterprise System stops receiving data from the <<acronym_dgw>> Service

*When* There is a communications failure between the <<acronym_dgw>> Service and the Enterprise System

*Then* The <<acronym_dgw>> Service will backfill missed data to the Enterprise System when communications resumes

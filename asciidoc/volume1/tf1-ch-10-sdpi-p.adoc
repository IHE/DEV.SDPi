[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_profile,sdpi_offset=10]
== Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability – Plug-and-trust (SDPi-P) Profile
[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_profile_reftext,reftext="SDPi-P Profile"]
The SDPi-Plug-and-trust ([[acronym_sdpi_p,SDPi-P]] SDPi-P) profile supports foundational seamless connectivity, information exchange and service invocation as defined in the SDPi architecture detailed in section <<vol1_clause_sdpi_overview_framework>> above.
Whereas the related SDPi profiles for reporting, alerting and external control are explicitly intended to support medical care capabilities, the SDPi-P profile focuses on basic healthcare device interoperability.
All the capabilities defined in SDPi-P are leveraged by and extended in the medically focused profiles.
This foundational profile not only supports medical device interoperability ("<<acronym_mdi>>"), providing for “plug-and-play” capabilities, but also with a tightly integrated “trust” framework (see <<vol1_appendix_a_requirements_management_for_p_n_t_interperability>>).
The establishment of a trusted ecosystem of medical and non-medical devices and applications footnote:[Note that SDPi-P supports application interoperability including “Software as a Medical Device” (<<acronym_samd>>).] begins at the start of discovery and a secure connection.  Therefore, the profile's name:  <<term_plug_and_trust>>.

_This_ is primarily an IHE transport profile footnote:[See the IHE Technical Frameworks General Introduction for a more detailed description of IHE profile types, published at https://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/[profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/].], although it does define several content modules detailed in IHE Devices TF-3.
It supports the transactions and information exchanged in accordance to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) specialized for high-acuity points of care (e.g., operating table or ICU bed), defined as a <<term_service_oriented_medical_device_system>>.
All the SDPi-P Actors are therefore scoped with “<<acronym_somds>>” to clearly identify their application context and scope.

Although all information exchanged between SDPi-P <<acronym_somds>> participating systems and applications must conform to the basic <<acronym_sdc>>/<<acronym_biceps>> content module requirements footnote:[See <<vol3_clause_sdc_biceps_semantic_content_module>>. ], content modules have been defined for common high-acuity medical devices such as infusion pumps, ventilators and physiologic monitors.

Note that future IHE _workflow profiles_ may be defined that build upon the transport & content module foundation established by the SDPi-P profile.
For example, Operating Room / Surgery Point-of-Care Integration, ICU Point-of-Care Integration, or more service-focused profiles such as Point-of-Care Identity Management (PCIM) for device-patient association management, or Silent ICU & Quiet Hospital, where the acute point-of-care is integrated with enterprise systems around device alerting and alert distribution to provide an improved environment of care (reduced noise level and improved safety) and clinician interaction.

<<vol1_figure_sdpi_p_biceps_content_actor_diagram>> shows the content-related actors defined in the SDPi-P Profile and the direction that the content is exchanged.

In general, the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> actor will create content for consumption by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor, but the communication cloud between the two actors indicates that the technical method of exchange is a separate concern for the semantic content.
Within the SDPi-P profile, the general "default" communication methods would be using the <<acronym_somds>> capabilities illustrated above in <<vol1_figure_sdpi_p_actor_diagram>> with the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_creator>> actor communicating content via the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> actor, and the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_consumer>> actor receiving it via the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor.
However, the content might also be formalized in a document as opposed to a message, and a different method of exchange and persistence utilized.

Note that in the case of external control, where a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor is creating and sending content (e.g., patient demographics information) to a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> actor, the content module creator / consumer roles will be reversed.

A product implementation using this profile may group Actors from this profile with Actors from a workflow or transport profile to be functional.
The grouping of the content module described in this profile to specific Actors is described in more detail in <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_required_actor_groupings>> or in <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_cross_profile_considerations>>.

[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_participant]
===== SOMDS Participant
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant, reftext='SOMDS Participant']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. A foundational abstract Actor that provides the SOA architectural constructs for interoperating in a Service-Oriented Medical Device System (SOMDS) network instance, including information, messaging and dynamic behavior models.   (See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>  “PARTICIPANT” definition)

All systems participating in a SOMDS network instance must implement this Abstract Actor.

All SDPi profiles Actors are grouped with (inherit from) this Actor, including both transport / transaction Actors and content module Actors.
This required grouping ensures that all systems connecting to a SOMDS network support the <<acronym_ses_mdi>>  requirements footnote:[See #General Introduction  Appendix A for more detail on <<acronym_ses_mdi>>] necessary for establishing a <<term_plug_and_trust>> ecosystem, including the secure and dynamic provision of an implementation’s <<term_system_function_contribution>>.

[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_provider]

[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider, reftext='SOMDS Provider']
Actor Summary Definition:

. A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> that provides at least one service to the other participant systems.  (See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>  “SERVICE PROVIDER” definition)

Every <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> is paired with (inherits from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_ actor.

A system that participates in a SOMDS network instance can include both <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> and <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> Actors.

[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_consumer]
===== SOMDS Consumer
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer, reftext='SOMDS Consumer']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> that discovers and utilizes at least one service, functional capability, exposed to a network communications backbone by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>. (See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>  “SERVICE CONSUMER” and “SERVICE” definitions.)

Every <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> is paired with (inherits from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_ actor.

A system that participates in a SOMDS network instance can include both <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> and <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>.

[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_connector]
===== SOMDS Connector
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector, reftext='SOMDS Connector']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. A _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_ that enables seamless interaction with systems and software applications that are outside the scope of the SOMDS network instance.  This abstract actor provides a consistent method for interacting, as a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> and / or <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>, with a specific SOMDS instance, as the foundation for protocol-specific gateway and platform actors.

Every abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ is grouped with (inherits from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_.

A _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ can implement both <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> and <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>.

In the case of a connector implementing a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> , it is able to interact with other <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>  to either obtain information that is then made available to Non-SOMDS Systems or invoke services that are requested from the external Non-SOMDS Systems.
For example, forwarding patient respiratory rate readings to an external “flow sheet” application or invoking a device’s “pause alert audio” service when a clinician indicates they are responding to a physiological alert condition (e.g., high respiratory rate).

In the case of a connector implementing a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>, service capabilities for interacting with Non-SOMDS Systems are provided to the other networked <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>.
For example, an application that wants to retrieve patient information from an EHR or check the latest patient laboratory results.

Note that the term “connector” is used to allow for SOMDS interaction with other systems that do not require protocol “gateway” adaptation, but do require a consistent interface to the other participants within a SOMDS environment.
See <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_sensor_gateway>> and <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_smart_app_platform>> for examples.

Each _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ gateway implementation will include the protocol-specific rules for connecting to and interacting with external non-SOMDS Systems, including semantic mappings, message formats, and interaction sequences.
See related discussion at <<vol3_clause_biceps_mapping_using_somds_connector_content_modules>>.

a| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*: For SDPi 1.0, the TF-3 SDC/BICEPS Mapping of SOMDS Connector Content Modules section is out-of-scope., but included above for completeness of this Actor overview.
|===

Although the SDPi-P profile _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ provides for non-SOMDS _protocol-specific_ adaptors, they establish the foundation for specifying system and application-specific interfaces such as for EHR or decision support systems (e.g., sepsis determination). See <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_ensuring_time_synchronization>>, and <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_aggregators_proxies_sensors>> for additional perspectives and concepts on how SOMDS Connectors may be implemented.

_<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ system implementations may support multiple protocols where there is one SOMDS-facing participant model or API but with multiple protocols for non-SOMDS system integration.
For example, a SOMDS “Alert” Gateway would interact with other _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>s_ in a single consistent way but may support both <<ref_hl7_fhir>> and <<ref_hl7_v2>> protocols for interacting with healthcare enterprise systems.

_<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ may also be utilized in other SDPi profiles for medical device information reporting (<<acronym_sdpi_r>>), alerting (<<acronym_sdpi_a>>) and external control (<<acronym_sdpi_xc>>). See those profile specifications for detailed usage.  In some cases, https://profiles.ihe.net/[IHE profiles] have been defined for supporting integration with Non-SOMDS Systems, such as the V2-based IHE Devices Device to Enterprise Communication (DEC) profile (See <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_1_2019>>), or the IHE ITI XDS-I for locating and retrieving images for a specific patient using the XDS.b profile.  In these cases, *_profile-specific_* _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ adaptors may be specified as well.

[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_fhir_gateway]
===== SOMDS FHIR Gateway
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_fhir_gateway, reftext='SOMDS FHIR Gateway']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. A _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ that supports use of <<ref_hl7_fhir>> for interoperating with Non-SOMDS Systems.

<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_fhir_gateway>> actors shall be grouped with (inherit from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ actor.
They shall implement either a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> and / or <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor.

The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_fhir_gateway>> actor identifies and specifies the logic necessary for connecting a SOMDS network environment with Non-SOMDS Systems that utilize <<ref_hl7_fhir>> for their interoperability protocol.  Generally, this logic is defined in the HL7 <<ref_hl7_fhir_pocd_ig>>.

Gateways implementing this actor can support any of the FHIR architectural approaches:  RESTful, messaging, documents, and SOA.
For example, a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_fhir_gateway>> can utilize a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> to retrieve information from other _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_ systems, map it into FHIR Bundle resources and forward it on to non-SOMDS systems in a FHIR message.

Alternatively, the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_fhir_gateway>> could implement a FHIR server and provide support for systems to discover and retrieve information asynchronously, including the use of FHIR publication / subscription (“pub/sub”) services.

The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_fhir_gateway>> can also support SOMDS services invoked by FHIR-based systems, such as requesting a snapshot of the latest vital signs measurements for a specific patient and triggering a blood-pressure cuff reading.

[#vol1_clause_sdpi_p_somds_v2_gateway]
===== SOMDS V2 Gateway
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_v2_gateway, reftext='SOMDS V2 Gateway']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>> that supports use of <<ref_hl7_v2>> for interoperating with Non-SOMDS Systems.

<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_v2_gateway>> actors shall be grouped with (inherit from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ actor.
They shall implement either a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> and / or <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor.

The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_v2_gateway>> actor identifies and specifies the logic necessary for connecting a SOMDS network environment with Non-SOMDS Systems that utilize <<ref_hl7_v2>> for their interoperability protocol.
Since V2 is a message-based protocol, the primary implementation guide logic is defined in <<vol2_clause_appendix_sdpi_gateway_hl7_v2_general_mapping>>.
Additional specifications for semantic content modules is detailed in <<vol3_clause_content_modules>>, including <<vol3_clause_biceps_relationship_to_classic_dim>>.

Generally, the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_v2_gateway>> actor supports messaging from a SOMDS environment to V2-enabled systems, utilizing a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor to collect information from <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> systems and translate them to V2 messages sent to other Non-SOMDS Systems.  There are cases, though, where information may be sent to a SOMDS-based system such as an alert conformation utilizing a DEV-05 (i.e., PCD-05) transaction (see the <<vol1_clause_sdpi_a_profile>> below).

. A _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_  that supports integration of sensors external to a SOMDS network.

<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_sensor_gateway>> actors shall be grouped with (inherit from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ actor.
They shall implement either a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> and / or <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor.

The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_sensor_gateway>> actor identifies and specifies the logic necessary for integration of signals and controls from small sensor and actuator devices that do not have the resources to support direct integration into a SOMDS network.
This includes integration of both wired and wireless sensor networks (“WSN”).

. A _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_  that supports connection to a SOMDS network that is optimized for applications, including <<term_software_as_a_medical_device>>.

<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_smart_app_platform>> actors shall be grouped with (inherit from) the abstract _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ actor.
They shall implement either a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> and / or <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> actor.

This actor leverages the consistent integration of a _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>_ to a SOMDS network environment but provides a simplified platform specification to support “smart apps” including <<term_software_as_a_medical_device>>.
For example, an application may only need to identify and consume a few parameters from one or more _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_ systems and not be required to implement a complete SOMDS interface including security, discovery, subscription management, filtering of unneeded <<acronym_mdib>> information, etc.

<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_smart_app_platform>> actors provide an abstraction layer between application software and the requirements for interoperating in a SOMDS network backbone.
Since a single platform actor can support multiple Smart Apps, network traffic may be significantly reduced, as well as processing overhead for <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> systems that have multiple <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>s simultaneously invoking their services.

The platform must support both non-smart app critical functions (such as network topology discovery and maintenance) but also aggregate app requirements (e.g., quality of service necessary to support an application’s algorithms).

See <<vol1_clause_smart_app_platforms>> for additional discussion.

===== BICEPS Content Creator
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_creator, reftext='BICEPS Content Creator']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. Provides <<acronym_mdib>> content conformant to <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> BICEPS specification and for consumption by other <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_consumer>> systems.

All content created and provided by a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_creator>> shall be conformant to the BICEPS content module specifications in <<vol3_clause_sdc_biceps_semantic_content_module>> and related sections.

Note that although this SDPi-P content actor primarily supports information exchange between systems participating in a SOMDS network environment, they may also be utilized by other non-SDPi profiles that support non-SOMDS exchange architectures, transactions and technologies.

Content is provided by one _<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>_ to another.
Typically, this will be a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> system to a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> system; however, as noted previously, in some cases such as changing configuration settings within a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> (e.g., Patient Context), content creation and provision is from a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> (initiating the configuration change request) to a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> system.

===== BICEPS Content Consumer
[#vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_consumer, reftext='BICEPS Content Consumer']
Actor Summary Definition:
[none]
. Processes <<acronym_mdib>> information conformant to <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> BICEPS specifications provided by <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_creator>> systems.

A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_biceps_content_consumer>> actor shall be capable of processing information provided by a <<actor_biceps_content_creator>>, in accordance to the BICEPS content module specifications in <<vol3_clause_sdc_biceps_semantic_content_module>> and related sections.

////

#TODO:  Removed the following line from the paragraph above ... BUT may want to add it in at some point in the future when multiple ways of processing "consumed" content is supported:

The supported BICEPS content processing shall include one or more of the options identified for this actor in <<vol1_table_sdpi_p_actor_options>> below.

////

For robustness, a <<actor_biceps_content_consumer>> need only process the content that is necessary to support its capabilities, but shall also be able to accept and ignore any additional content that may be provided but is out-of-scope for its internal requirements. footnote:[Apply Postel’s Law:  Send conservatively, Accept liberally.]

Note that although this SDPi-P content actor primarily supports information exchange between systems participating in a SOMDS network environment, they may be referenced by other non-SDPi profiles that utilize other non-SOMDS exchange architectures, transactions and technologies.

a| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*:  As indicated in <<vol1_figure_sdpi_p_actor_diagram>> above, there are no explicit grouped actors in this profile; however, there are abstract Actors (<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> and <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>>), and the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_connector>> may implement interfaces to <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> or <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> to provide bidirectional exchanges with non-<<acronym_somds>> systems.
These actor relationships do not represent typical IHE grouped actors, but should be represented in more explicit detail.

===== SOA & SOMDS Architecture Alignment
////
#TODO: Link back to SDPi general overview at the top and how leveraged for SDPi-P Actors Model;  SOMDS Participant ABSTRACT actor role#
////

From a conceptual perspective, <<acronym_sdc>> implements a <<acronym_soa>> architecture for device-to-device <<term_plug_and_trust>> interoperability.  Consider <<figure_general_soa_model>>:

.General Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Model
[#figure_general_soa_model]
image::../images/vol1-diagram-sdc-soa-conceptual-model.svg[align=center]

This generalized model includes (3) system roles:

. *Service Providers* -- indicate the capabilities or services that they support, often published to a centralized registry that all participating systems recognize;

. *Service Registry* -- a <<acronym_soa>> network capability enabling participating systems to *_discover_* services provided by networked systems, as well as information for how a service consumer system can

////
#TODO: ADD --#

* #why somds#
* #distributed registry#
* #somds participant#
* #somds provider and consumer mappings#
* #same system can support both roles; all systems mush support participant#
////

NOTE:  A detailed overview of <<acronym_soa>> concepts is beyond the scope of this specification.  See <<vol1_appendix_b_references>> for additional background materials.

The <<acronym_sdc>> <<acronym_biceps>> standard, which SDPi-P profiles, consists of (3) core components, as illustrated in <<figure_sdc_biceps_components_model>>:

.SDC/BICEPS Components Model
[#figure_sdc_biceps_components_model]
image::../images/vol1-diagram-sdc-biceps-component-view.svg[align=center]

The <<term_medical_data_information_base>> component applies to all participating systems and consists of a *_descriptive model_* (e.g., what services and information a <<actor_somds_provider>> supports), and a state model.
The discovery and communications models combine to enable device-to-device messaging and to identify both systems and services available on the network.
The descriptive model is covered in more detail in <<vol3_clause_sdc_biceps_semantic_content_module>>, but the following <<figure_sdc_biceps_mdib_descriptors_states>> shows how network efficiency is achieved by searating descriptive information from dynamic state information:

.SDC/BICEPS MDIB Descriptors & States
[#figure_sdc_biceps_mdib_descriptors_states]
image::../images/vol1-diagram-sdc-biceps-mdib-description-state.svg[align=center]

For every <<actor_somds_provider>> system, there is a descriptive model that includes a detailed specification of every element in the <<acronym_mdib>>.
For each Descriptor, though, there is a State element (note the inclusion of a State::DescriptorHandle), that can be used to determine the value and change status for the associated descriptor.
Therefore, though the <<acronym_mdib>> of a <<actor_somds_provider>> system must be retrieved at discovery and connection time, subsequent updates can be made upon state changes, greatly reducing network communication overhead.

For an example of how <<acronym_biceps>> components (see <<figure_sdc_biceps_components_model>>) and <<acronym_mdib>> descriptors and states (see <<figure_sdc_biceps_mdib_descriptors_states>>) support <<term_plug_and_trust>> interoperability, a typical conversation is provided in <<vol1_figure_sdpi_p_example_sequence_diagram>>.

===== Medical Device Profile for Web Services (MDPWS)
To support the <<acronym_soa>>-based connectivity described above, the *_default transport technology_* for this <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_profile_reftext>> is the XML-based Web Services as specified in <<ref_ieee_11073_20702_2016>>.
Additional "glue" constraints for this <<acronym_mdpws>> specification are provided in the companion standard: <<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>>.
Specific <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_profile_reftext>> transaction message bindings and examples are provided in <<vol2_appendix_a_mdpws_messages>>.

Requirements from the <<ref_iso_81001_1_2021>>, <<ref_iec_80001_1_2021>>, and related standards should be fully applied to this technical framework element.

For additional guidance, see section <<vol1_clause_appendix_a_ses_considerations_and_requirements>>.

==== Safety Requirements & Considerations
No additional safety requirements or considerations are identified for this technical framework element beyond those specified in the _<<acronym_ses>> General Considerations_ section above.

==== Effectiveness Requirements & Considerations
No additional effectiveness requirements or considerations are identified for this technical framework element beyond those specified in the _<<acronym_ses>> General Considerations_ section above.
==== Security Requirements & Considerations
Security is foundational for all interactions between <<actor_somds_participant>> actors, with a clear distinction being made between information that may be exchanged outside of a secure connection (e.g., during network discovery transactions).
Specific security technologies may vary based on the implementation technology being used, and will be detailed in the appropriate TF-2 technology specifications.
All transactions indicate whether they require secure or unsecured connections.

For the default <<acronym_sdpi_p>> connectivity technology, namely ISO/IEEE 11073 <<term_service_oriented_device_connectivity>>, TLS 1.2 (or later versions) support is required (See <<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>> and <<ref_ieee_11073_20702_2016>>).
Additional information and requirements may be provided in <<vol2_appendix_a_mdpws_messages>>.

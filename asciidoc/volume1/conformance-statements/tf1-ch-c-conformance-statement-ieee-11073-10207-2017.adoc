| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*: This section is provided as a placeholder for the <<acronym_ics>> table specification that will be added in the subsequent SDPi 1.2 supplement version.
The tables will have an additional SDPi column added to the right side that indicates *if* and TBD *where* the requirement is satisfied.
Requirement Definition (this table's rows) will be referenced where they are satisfied; however, these tables may also include forward references, at least in general, to what capabilities / requirements satisfy the referenced standard requirement.

*Standard Version:*  IEEE 11073-10207:2017

===== General

WARNING:  GEN-1 & GEN-4 are broken references, GEN-2 and GEN-3 are satisfied by Glue, GEN-4 should be mandatory as extensions.

ADD IEEE:  *Table 20 -- General ICSs table here*

===== Service Provider

Optional requirements for the service provider side excluding contexts and external control.

ADD IEEE:  *Service Provider ICS table here*

===== Service Consumer

NOTE:  CONS-1 is broken; R0115 is not optional in the released document.

ADD IEEE:  *Service Consumer ICS table here*

===== Remote Control

ADD IEEE:  *Remote Control ICS table here*

===== Context Processing

NOTE: Context processing pertains to effective utilization of context information like workflow (e.g., orders) info, patient demographics and locations.
A general concept should be described how to cope with contexts in terms of SDPi, i.e. device coupling mechanisms should be described informally in TF-1 and formally in TF-2 (as transaction?).

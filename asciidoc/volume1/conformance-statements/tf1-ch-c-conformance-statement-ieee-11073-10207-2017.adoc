| *{supplement_note}*: This section is provided as a placeholder for the <<acronym_ics>> table specification that will be added in a subsequent SDPi supplement version.
The tables will have an additional SDPi column added to the right side that indicates *if* and TBD *where* the requirement is satisfied.
Requirement Definition (this table's rows) will be referenced where they are satisfied; however, these tables may also include forward references, at least in general, to what capabilities / requirements satisfy the referenced standard requirement.

*Standard Version:*  IEEE 11073-10207:2017

===== General

WARNING:  GEN-1 and GEN-4 are broken references, GEN-2 and GEN-3 are satisfied by Glue, GEN-4 should be mandatory as extensions.

ADD IEEE:  *Table 20 -- General ICSs table here*

===== Service Provider

Optional requirements for the service provider side excluding contexts and external control.

a| *{supplement_note}*: Context processing pertains to effective utilization of context information like workflow (e.g., orders) info, patient demographics and locations.
A future version of SDPi will describe how to cope with contexts, with device coupling mechanisms described informally in TF-1 and formally in TF-2 (possibly as a transaction).

[#vol3_clause_report-sequence]
====== Report sequence

BICEPS does not provide a method for consumers to detect missing or out of order notification messages delivered during publish-subscribe sessions established through Transaction [DEV-27] (<<vol2_clause_dev_27>>). Notification messages may be lost, for example, in complex implementations with proxy and/or relay services between the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> and <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>. Notification messages may arrive out-of-order, for example, in complex systems using load-balancing servers to receive reports. 

This extension provides a mechanism for a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> to include message numbers to order the sequence of notification messages delivered during a publish-subscribe session. This mechanism supports both full subscribers ( <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>s that subscribe to every report offered by a  <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>), and partial subscribers (<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>s that subscribe to a subset of reports offered by a  <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>). Well designed <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>s may choose, where feasible, a subset of reports to reduce processing requirements and network bandwidth consumption.

====== Model

The report sequence XML schema is available in <<vol3_appendix_a_xml_schemas_report_sequence>>. <<vol3_example_extension_report_sequence>> shows an exemplary XML instance of a <<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_29, {var_label_dev_29_message_metricreport}>> including the report sequence extension in the message header.

.<<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_29, {var_label_dev_29_message_metricreport}>> with report sequence extension.

[NORMATIVE]
====
The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> shall set the
`sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` to 1 for the first notification message 
sent in a new publish-subscribe session.
====

[NOTE]
====
* A new publish-subscribe session begins when the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>
 receives a Subscribe message.

* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> may send the first report before sending 
the SubscribeResponse message.

* The `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` is scoped to the publish-subscribe 
session. Different subscriptions may share the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber`.

****
[NORMATIVE]
====
The <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> shall increment the 
`sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` by exactly 1 only when it receives confirmation 
of successful delivery of the notification message.
====

[NOTE]
====
* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> only increments the 
`sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` for successfully delivered notification messages.

* Successful delivery for <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>s using 
<<ref_w3c_soap_over_http_v1_2, SOAP over HTTP transport>> is indicated by an HTTP status 
code between 200 and 299.

* A response may be generated by a server layer before the message reaches a 
<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>. HTTP response 503 (service unavailable) is an 
example of a status code that may be generated by a server layer. The 
<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> does not change the `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` 
when it receives a fault status response. 

* An absent response could mean either the notification or the notification response
was not delivered due to a network fault.

====
Two reports sent with the same `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber` shall be functionally identical
unless the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> receives a fault response to a notification 
message from the recipient.
====


[NOTE]
====
* Two reports, containing information to update the MDIB for example, are functionally 
identical when applying either report to update the MDIB would produce an identical result. 

* A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> may change the content of a report to resolve 
a fault when it receives a fault response. For example, a provider may send fewer historic 
reports after receiving a 413 status response (content too large) when using an HTTP transport. 

* A timeout (no response or partial response) should not be considered a fault response from 
the recipient. A timeout on the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> may occur when the 
<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>>'s response is not delivered. A 
<<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> doesn't change the message content if if receives no response. 

* The transport channel may be closed, flushed or otherwise reset when no response or a partial 
response is received without affecting the `sdpi:ReportSequence/@MessageNumber`.

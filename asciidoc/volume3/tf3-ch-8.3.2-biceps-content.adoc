===== SDC/BICEPS Content Module

The <<acronym_biceps>> standard, <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>, provides an extensive semantic model for all information exchanged between <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> systems.  This section provides a general background for <<acronym_biceps>>-based content, including both what is unique to this standard (e.g., different from the <<term_classic_dim>>), and any extensions that are made by this SDPi supplement.

// 8.3.2.
===== BICEPS Descriptive Model

As described in <<vol1_clause_sdpi_p_soa_somds_architecture_alignment>> (see <<figure_sdc_biceps_mdib_descriptors_states>>), all <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> systems support an <<acronym_mdib>> model that has both medical device description and state components.  <<figure_sdc_participant_model_descriptive_part>> below provides the next level of detail for the descriptive part of the <<acronym_mdib>>:

.SDC/BICEPS MDIB Descriptive Model Components
[#figure_sdc_participant_model_descriptive_part]
image::../images/vol3-diagram-sdc-participant-model-descriptive-part.svg[align=center]

This model, detailed in <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>, provides a basic set of objects and containment relationships for describing the information and services supported by a medical device.

The core Medical Device System (*MDS*), Virtual Medical Device (*VMD*), Channel, and Metric objects are utilized for communicating basic information; whereas, the Alert System objects (not all are included on this diagram) support the specialized information around medical device alerts, alarms, and special events.
What is unique to this descriptor model, though, is the inclusion of a set of SystemContext objects, as identified in <<figure_sdc_biceps_mdib_system_context_types_model>> below:

.SDC/BICEPS MDIB System Context Types Model
[#figure_sdc_biceps_mdib_system_context_types_model]
image::../images/vol3-diagram-sdc-system-context-types.svg[align=center]

These  context types combine to support description of the operational environment for a device.
Depending on a systems capabilities, they may be configured -- statically or dynamically -- with context information such as location or patient identification, or they may discover a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> on the network from which they can retrieve the information.
These context types represent a significant improvement over previous medical device <<acronym_mdib>> description capabilities.

NOTE:  A detailed description of this <<acronym_biceps>> description information model is beyond the scope of this specification.  Detailed information is available in the <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> standard and other materials identified in <<vol1_appendix_b_references>>.

a| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*: This version of the supplement does not fully support profiles of all the elements in the descriptive model, including:

* Service Control Object (SCO) and Operations
* Battery objects

Additionally, only limited support for the *_AlertSystem_* (and related objects), and for the *_SystemContext_* types are provided in SDPi 1.1.
Subsequent versions of the specification will address complete functionality.

[#vol3_clause_biceps_relationship_to_classic_dim]
===== BICEPS Relationship to Classic DIM

As can be seen from <<figure_sdc_participant_model_descriptive_part>> above, the core elements of the <<term_classic_dim>> (as specified in <<ref_ieee_11073_10201_2004>> and described in <<vol3_clause_ieee_11073_10201_classic_dim_content_modules>>), are directly supported by the <<acronym_biceps>> model above in <<figure_sdc_participant_model_descriptive_part>>.
The basic containment from MDS to VMD to Channel to Metric is maintained within <<acronym_biceps>>, ensuring continuity with the broadly-implemented <<term_classic_dim>>

===== Nomenclature Considerations â€“ Private Extensions & External Systems

The <<acronym_biceps>> specification fully supports the private nomenclature extensions as defined in <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>>.  Additionally it supports integration of other non-<<acronym_mdc>> terminology systems.

See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> for additional details.

// 8.3.2.
[#vol3_clause_system_type_nomenclature_extensions]
===== System Type Nomenclature Extensions
In addition to specific device specializations (see <<vol3_clause_device_specialization_content_modules>> below), SDPi specifications, especially TF-1 use cases, refer to a number of general classes or types of systems.  These systems provide common services to all other <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>>'s; however, in order to be discovered on the network, they must have system type identifiers that can be recognized by these other systems (explicitly / implicitly).

[#vol3_clause_globally_unique_code_system_id]
===== Globally Unique Vendor-specific Coding System Identifier

The <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>> nomenclature standard gives medical device vendors the freedom to define their own codes for new concepts which are currently not part of the standard nomenclature.

The <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022>> Base Requirements for Participants in a Service-Oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) System defines two requirements for use of private codes as detailed in <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>>:

* *TR1357*: If there is no standardized code to convey semantics, an SDC BASE PARTICIPANT S-H-O-U-L-D populate pm:CodedValue with a private code as detailed in [IEEE 11073-10101].

* *TR1358*: If an SDC BASE PARTICIPANT uses a private code as detailed in [IEEE 11073-10101], the SDC BASE PARTICIPANT S-H-A-L-L refer to its definition by providing a *pm:Translation* with a *@CodingSystem* that uniquely identifies the private coding system that contains the code.

NOTE: This implies that a MANUFACTURER that needs to use private codes has to keep a private coding system for these codes. Following the concept of private codes that is defined in <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>>, a MANUFACTURER introduces and maintains a set of codes that adhere to the principles of the <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>> nomenclature standards.

There are different ways to define a globally unique identifier for the vendor-specific private coding system (e. g. URL, OID, etc.). In the context of medical device interoperability, the recommendation is to use  an "object identifier" (OID) for private codes as detailed in <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>> and other purposes (e. g. private SDC extensions):

* Compared with other identifiers (e.g. URLs) OIDs are very compact, which helps to keep the size of data messages low

* It is free of charge to register a globally unique enterprise OID with https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/assignment/apply/[IANA].

An enterprise OID assigned by IANA always starts with the prefix *iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise (1.3.6.1.4.1)*. The actual enterprise node number, which follows the prefix, is globally unique to the medical device vendor (e. g. "_1.3.6.1.4.1.12345_" for the *Medical Device XYZ Ltd.* company).

Once the enterprise OID is registered, it is up to the medical device vendor to extend the OID by adding child nodes. The child nodes don't have a globally unique meaning, but the enterprise OID plus the child nodes are required to be globally unique. It is recommended to define a child node schema, and assign unique numbers to the concepts on each node level.

.OID Vendor-specific Child Node Schema
====
 * 1.3.6.1.4.1.12345.*<Namespace>*: this could be, for example, the business group id within the enterprise ("Patient Monitoring" = 1, "Ventilation" = 2, etc.).
 * 1.3.6.1.4.1.12345.*<Namespace>*.*<Type>*: this could be, for example, the id of the type defined within the business group of the enterprise ("Private Code System" = 1, "SDC Extensions" = 2, etc.)
* 1.3.6.1.4.1.12345.*<Namespace>*.*<Type>*.*<Version>*: it is highly recommended to define the version number as the last child node in the OID. Different versions indicate a major (maybe breaking) change to the *Type* defined by the parent node.
====

In the example above, the OID "_1.3.6.1.4.1.12345.2.1.1_" would represent a *private coding system* identifier in version *1* issued by the the *ventilation* business group of the *Medical Device XYZ Ltd.* company.

.R0702
[sdpi_requirement#r0702,sdpi_req_level=shall]

The companies claiming conformity with the IHE SDPi profile shall disclose their OIDs used for private codes as detailed in <<ref_ieee_11073_10101_2020>>, for private SDC extensions, and so on.

===== Safety, Effectiveness, Security Content Requirements & Considerations

[%noheader]
[%autowidth]
[cols="1"]
|===
a| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*:  The <<acronym_sdc>> standards community is evaluating the use of safety class elements in the BICEPS specification (see <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>), and the related https://github.com/IHE/DEV.SDPi/issues/11[Github Issue #11 _Topic: SDPi-xC with Mixed Device Safety Classes_].
The result of that discussion will directly impact the BICEPS SES Considerations Section below.

For this version of the specification, the following wording has been suggested:

[none]
. _The purpose of the BICEPS attribute @SafetyClassification is to classify the quality and criticality of data and operations. The usage of this attribute is under discussion in IEEE 11073 PoCD and IHE DEV DPI. Additionally, the value set definition in BICEPS is under discussion. Consequently, this document version does not yet include guidance or requirements on the usage of @SafetyClassification._

|===


====== SES General Considerations
Requirements from the <<ref_iso_81001_1_2021>>, <<ref_iec_80001_1_2021>>, and related standards should be fully applied to this technical framework element.

For additional guidance, see Section <<vol1_clause_appendix_a_ses_considerations_and_requirements>>.

====== Safety Requirements & Considerations
No additional safety requirements or considerations are identified for this technical framework element beyond those specified in the _<<acronym_ses>> General Considerations_ Section above.

====== Effectiveness Requirements & Considerations
No additional effectiveness requirements or considerations are identified for this technical framework element beyond those specified in the _<<acronym_ses>> General Considerations_ Section above.

====== Security Requirements & Considerations
Secure exchange of content between medical devices is a foundational requirement for all system-to-system interactions.
Though management of secure connections is generally a technical issue and not one specific to semantic content, close consideration should be made to ensure that information exchanged in potentially unsecured contexts does not pose an unacceptable risk.

Additional security requirements and considerations may be identified in the  <<acronym_sdpi_p>> profile, and those specified in the _<<acronym_ses>> General Considerations_ Section above.

// 8.3.2.
===== BICEPS Conventions for device specialization content modules

// 8.3.2.9
[#vol3_clause_biceps_extension_model]
===== BICEPS Extension Model

IEEE 11073-10207 provides a flexible extension model.
This enables manufacturers to add information that does not fit into the defined structure.
Therefore, nearly every element in the participant and message model contains an extension point (`ext:Extension`).
However, the fundamental rules are: Do not use a proprietary extension if the purpose of the extension can be expressed by (in the specified order)

. the given participant and message models,
. a standardized coded value,
. a standardized extension, or
. a private coded value.


The borders of using extension are given by:

* <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> Clause 8, especially R0109, and
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022>> Clause 6.7

There are two kinds of extensions, those the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> must understand to perform system functions safely with the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>>, and those the <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_consumer>> does not have to understand.
This is indicated by the Boolean attribute `@ext:MustUnderstand`.
Consequently, a manufacturer of a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> should be careful defining extensions with `@ext:MustUnderstand = true`, as this potentially reduces interoperability.

There are standardized extensions, like those that are specified in the PKP standards or this specification, which can be considered common knowledge and therefore do not break interoperability between different manufacturers.

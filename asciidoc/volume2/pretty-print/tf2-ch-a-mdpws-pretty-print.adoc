==== XML Pretty-Print

XML processor implementations may pretty-print XML by default when serializing XML instance documents, which can cause unexpected errors for validating XML parsers.
Pretty-printed XML aligns XML elements in new lines and adds indentation where necessary to beautify serialized data and therewith increase human-readability.
However, if the serializer is not XML-Schema-agnostic, it ignores _mixed content_ declarations and hence can change the meaning of elements in instance documents that are supposed to contain _mixed content_.

<<r0013>> requires XML serializers to be XML Schema agnostic. If, e.g., for technical reasons, a serializer cannot be XML Schema agnostic, it is not allowed to pretty-print XML data as it may generate invalid XML markup.

[NORMATIVE]
====
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> shall serialize XML instance documents in accordance to its applicable XML Schema definitions.

[NOTE]
====
This requirement stems from the need to avoid pretty-print output if an XML serializer does not understand or know the underlying XML Schema definitions.

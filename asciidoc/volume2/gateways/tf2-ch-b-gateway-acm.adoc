=== SDPi ACM Gateway -- Mapping

==== Scope
This chapter defines the mapping from the <<acronym_mdib>> content as defined in this document and its underlying standards, to IHE Alert Communication Management (ACM) Profile messages as defined in the <<ref_ihe_dev_tf_2_2024>>.

The <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> represents the Alarm Reporter (AR) role of the IHE ACM profile.

The following sections supplement the IHE ACM Profile as appropriate. If there are no supplementing definitions, the definitions as described in the <<ref_ihe_dev_tf_2_2024>> apply.

==== Referenced Standards & Profiles
This section provides an overview about the referenced standards and profiles used in this chapter:

* <<ref_ihe_dev_tf_2_2024>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10702_202x>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10701_2022>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>

==== Private MDC Codes Consideration
Please refer to general Section <<ref_private_coding_system_note>>.

==== HL7 Segment Descriptions
The following sections refer to the *Appendix B Common Segment Descriptions* of the <<ref_ihe_dev_tf_2_2024>>.

===== MSH - Message Header Segment
Please refer to general Section <<ref_gateway_msh_mapping>>.

===== PID - Patient Identification Segment
Please refer to general Section <<ref_gateway_pid_mapping>>.

===== PV1 - Patient Visit Segment
Please refer to general Section <<ref_gateway_pv1_mapping>>.

===== OBR - Observation Request Segment
The HL7 Observation Request (OBR) segment requires a mapping from the SDC containment tree and metric data to the OBR segment fields.

===== OBX - Observation/Result Segment
The OBX segment is utilized to export seven alert event attributes in the following order as defined in the <<ref_ihe_dev_tf_2_2024>>:

* Event identification
* Source identification
* Event phase
* Alert state
* Inactivation State
* Alert Priority
* Alert Type

The OBX segments representing the alert event attributes are preceded by up to three device-related OBX segments for the MDS, VMD and CHANNEL (see also <<ref_acm_obx_device_related_mapping>> for further information).

In this case, the date/time is determined by the gateway for this message.

* The mapping differs for physiological alert events and technical/advisory alert events (refer to <<ref_tbl_acm_obx_alert_type_mapping>> for further information).

* For physiological alert conditions, the alert event usually relates to a metric and its corresponding value that triggered the alert event. The *pm:AlertConditionDescriptor/pm:Source* element contains the handle to the related metric for the alert condition.

* For technical alert conditions, the alert event usually relates to a device-related element such as the MDS, a VMD, a CHANNEL, or METRIC. The *pm:AlertConditionDescriptor/pm:Source* element usually contains the handle to the device-related element. If *pm:Source* is empty, the alert condition relates to the device-related element which is the parent of the alert system to which the alert condition is assigned to.

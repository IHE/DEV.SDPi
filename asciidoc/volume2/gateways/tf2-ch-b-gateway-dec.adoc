=== SDPi DEC Gateway -- Mapping

==== Scope
This chapter defines the mapping from the <<acronym_mdib>> content as defined in this document and its underlying standards, to IHE Device Enterprise Communication (DEC) profile messages as defined in the <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>>.

The <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> represents the Device Observation Reporter (DOR) role of the IHE DEC profile.

The following sections supplement the IHE DEC profile as appropriate. If there are no supplementing definitions, the definitions as described in the <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>> will apply.

==== Referenced Standards & Profiles
This section provides an overview about the referenced standards and profiles used in this chapter:

* <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10701_2022>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022>>
* <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>

==== Private MDC Codes Consideration
Please refer to general section <<ref_private_coding_system_note>>.

==== HL7 Segment Descriptions
The following sections refer to the *Appendix B Common Segment Descriptions* of the <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>>.

===== MSH - Message Header Segment
Please refer to general section <<ref_gateway_msh_mapping>>.

===== PID - Patient Identification Segment
Please refer to general section <<ref_gateway_pid_mapping>>.

===== Height and Weight Mapping

The *pm:PatientContextState/pm:CoreData* element may also contain elements for a patient's height and/or weight.

.R8001
[sdpi_requirement#r8001,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
If available, the <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall export height and weight as OBX segments on the MDS level.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The mapping for the height observation is defined in table <<ref_tbl_dec_obx_height_mapping>> and the weight mapping in table <<ref_tbl_dec_obx_weight_mapping>>.
====
****

[#ref_height_weight_dt_issue_note]
====== Height/Weight Observation Date Time Consideration

In the SDC Domain Information and Service Model, there are no explicit timestamps for the height and weight observation in *pm:PatientContextState/pm:CoreData* element.
The only timestamp associated with the current patient context state is the *pm:PatientContextState/@BindingStartTime*, but this timestamp is set only once when the context was associated regardless whether height and weight has been set or updated later.

The gateway could also keep track of the *pm:PatientContextState* updates and evaluate height/weight value changes in the state updates.
The state update timestamp has to be set by the SDC gateway consumer when it receives the new context state.
That timestamp could be used for the height and/or weight observation that has been changed.
The problem is that when the gateway loses connection to the PoC device it can only get the latest state update with a new version number but there is no timestamp related to the new state.

.R8002
[sdpi_requirement#r8002,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall use the *pm:PatientContextState/@BindingStartTime* as the timestamp for the height and weight observation and send new values as corrected results.

[#ref_dec_OBR7_mapping]
====== OBR-7 Observation Date/Time
The OBR-7 field specifies the time point or start of time interval for all OBX segments within the scope of this OBR segment, that is, OBX segments that are part of the ORDER_OBSERVATION segment group, that do not specify an overriding time point in the OBX-14 field.

The presence of an overriding time point in OBX-14 indicates an episodic measurement such as non-invasive blood pressure.

The absence of an overriding time point in the OBX-14 field implies that this is an instance of a periodically sampled observation with a time stamp given by OBR-7 field.

.R8037
[sdpi_requirement#r8037,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****

A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall export continuously (periodically) measured metrics periodically at a defined interval.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: It is up to the <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> how the export interval is defined. The interval might be a fixed interval of e.g. 30 seconds, or a configurable interval ranging e.g. between 10 seconds and 2 minutes.

====
****

.R8038
[sdpi_requirement#r8038,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****

A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBR-7 field to the start date and time of current export interval.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: If, for example, the export interval is set to 30 seconds, the <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> will export HL7 messages every 30 seconds with the OBR-7 field set to start date and time of the interval e.g. *20231030155930*, *20231030160000*, *20231030160030*, and so on.

====
****

.R8006
[sdpi_requirement#r8006,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****

A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall export the latest metric value of all continuously (periodically) measured metrics with a *pm:AbstractMetricState+++<wbr/>+++/pm:MetricValue+++<wbr/>+++/@DeterminationTime* which is equal or greater than the start date and time of the current interval, and less than the start date and time of the next export interval.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The OBR-7 field is set to the start time of the interval. The individual periodic metric value *@DeterminationTime* is basically ignored, but has to be within the time boundaries of the current export interval.

====
****

.R8007
[sdpi_requirement#r8007,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****

For exporting episodic metric values and the absence of any continuously measured metric values for the current export interval, a <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBR-7 field to the start date and time of current export interval.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: Episodic metric values are usually exported along with the periodic metric values in the same export intervals. However, if a device does not provide periodic metric values in the current export interval, episodic metric values are exported in current export interval without periodic metric values.

NOTE: The *pm:AbstractMetricState+++<wbr/>+++/pm:MetricValue+++<wbr/>+++/@DeterminationTime* of an episodic metric value is set in the OBX-14 field and will override the timestamp defined in the OBR-7 field.

====
****

[NOTE]
Only metrics that fulfil certain criteria are exported by the <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>>. Please refer to <<r8018>> and <<r8017>> for further information.

====== OBX-7 Reference Range

.R8026
[sdpi_requirement#r8026,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall define the range of the alert limits on the metric level, if the *@Handle* of the metric is referenced by a *pm:LimitAlertConditionDescriptor* in the *pm:LimitAlertConditionDescriptor/pm:Source* list, by the format `<Lower Limit> - <Upper Limit>` where

* `<Lower Limit>` is set to *pm:LimitAlertConditionState/pm:Limits/@Lower* and
* `<Upper Limit>` is set to *pm:LimitAlertConditionState/pm:Limits/@Upper*.

.Notes

****

.R8025
[sdpi_requirement#r8025,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall not set this field to the device measurement range capability for device related segments.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: As stated in <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>> the reference range can only be set for device related segments (e.g. Channel). Within SDC the device measurement range refers to each metric and cannot be populated on higher levels in the containment tree.
====
****

====== OBX-8 Abnormal Flags

The OBX-8 field is not required to be set since the gateway exports valid and validated metric data only.

.R8027
[sdpi_requirement#r8027,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall leave the OBX-8 field empty as specified in the <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>> for valid and validated metric values.
****

====== OBX-11 Observation Result Status

.R8028
[sdpi_requirement#r8028,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
For a device-related element such as MDS, VMD, or CHANNEL, a <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBX-11 field to *"X"*.
****

.R8029
[sdpi_requirement#r8029,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
For metrics with the *pm:AbstractMetricValue/pm:MetricQuality/@Validity* set to *Vld* (Valid), a <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBX-11 field to *"R"*.
****

.R8030
[sdpi_requirement#r8030,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
For metrics with the *pm:AbstractMetricValue/pm:MetricQuality/@Validity* set to *Vldated* (Validated Data), a <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBX-11 field to *"F"*.
****

====== OBX-14 Date/Time of Observation

.R8031
[sdpi_requirement#r8031,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBX-14 field to the date and time of the intermittently measured metric value.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: Intermittently measured metrics have the *pm:AbstractMetricDescriptor/@MetricAvailability* set to "*Intr*".

NOTE: <<ref_tbl_dec_obx14_mapping>> defines the mapping of the SDC metric measurement timestamp to the data fields of the HL7 data type *DTM* used in the OBX-14 field.

====== OBX-17 Observation Method

.R8033
[sdpi_requirement#r8033,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> shall set the OBX-17 field to one of the coded terms as specified in <<ref_tbl_dec_obx17_mapping>>, depending on the *pm:AbstractMetricDescriptor/@MetricCategory* (Category) and the *pm:AbstractMetricDescriptor/@DerivationMethod* (Derivation).
****

.R8039
[sdpi_requirement#r8039,sdpi_req_level=should]

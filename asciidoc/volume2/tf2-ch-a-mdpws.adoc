=== Security Considerations

In TR1164, <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022, IEEE 11073-10700>> requires a <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider>> to protect <<acronym_biceps>> services against unauthenticated access.
In order to fulfill TR1164, <<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018, IEEE 11073-20701>> specifies the need to establish secure channels between <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> by using TLS with mutual authentication.

.R0502
[sdpi_requirement#r0502,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_participant>> shall use HTTPS with mutual authentication for those transactions that are required to be secured.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: Each section that specifies a transaction indicates security requirements in the __Security Requirements & Considerations__ subsection beneath the __Safety, Effectiveness and Security - Requirements and Considerations__ of each transaction.

NOTE: Essentially, this specification asks for secured transmission of data except when ad-hoc discovery is performed.
====
****

CAUTION: This appendix does not specify any processes towards certificate governance. Certificate governance is a separate topic that needs to be addressed in future revisions of this specification.

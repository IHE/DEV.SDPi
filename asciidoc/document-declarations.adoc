a| *SDPi Supplement Version Note*:

The following table is included in this version of the supplement to capture *_"forward" declarations of acronyms and labels_* that are used in the text but are not intended to be part of the General Introduction Appendix D Glossary.
"Forward" means that they are used BEFORE the document section in which they are formally defined.
Since AsciiDoc is a one-pass processor, forward declarations are required.

There was no clear way of defining these replacement definitions in a way that is "under the hood" and not visible to the reader.
The following table was thus created but may be moved or otherwise implemented in subsequent supplement versions.

Suggestions appreciated!

NOTE:  Forward Declarations in the following table are being added "on demand" or when needed and not comprehensively for every acronym defined in the document that is not also included in the Glossary.

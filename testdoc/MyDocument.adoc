Don't worry about gumberoos or splintercats.
Something far more fearsome plagues the days, nights, and inbetweens.
Wolpertingers.

== Origins

Wolpertingers are {url-wolpertinger}[ravenous beasts].

== Requirements list

Here are the requirements for providers. 

sdpi_requirement_list::[sdpi_req_group=provider]

Here are the requirements for consumers. 

sdpi_requirement_list::[sdpi_req_group=consumer]

Here are the requirements for consumers and discovery proxies. 

sdpi_requirement_list::[sdpi_req_group="consumer,discovery-proxy"]



== Some requirements

.R1021
[sdpi_requirement,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_req_type=tech_feature,sdpi_req_group="provider,discovery-proxy",sdpi_req_specification=sdpi-p]
****

[NORMATIVE]
When the vol1_spec_sdpi_p_option_discovery_proxy is enabled for a vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider Actor, then it shall use the vol2_clause_dev_46, DEV-46 transaction to update the vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_discovery_proxy Actor on its network presence and departure.

When the vol1_spec_sdpi_p_option_discovery_proxy is enabled for a vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_somds_provider Actor, then it should use the vol2_clause_dev_46, DEV-46 transaction to update the vol1_spec_sdpi_p_actor_discovery_proxy Actor on its network presence and departure.

[NOTE]
Let's start at the very beginning; a very good place to start!
